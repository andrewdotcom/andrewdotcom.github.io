      <p>It&rsquo;s turning out to be a lot harder than I imagined to sit down each week and write up a set of weeknotes. I think I may be over complicating it. Eitherway I am quite a few weeks behind now. So many in fact that I have forgotten what week I am on.</p>
<p>Going forward i am just going to write up weeknotes when I can and bring all the things that have happened in the period together. We&rsquo;ll also drop the week number.</p>
<p>So what has happened? Well More than Machines continues to develop. Lots of interesting conversations and a few pieces of work. Still tracking behind on sales but i&rsquo;m only 8 weeks in and have been focused on one customer to date. If I am honest I have also been taking it easy. I burned out in my previous job and I am only just starting to feel human again. I didn&rsquo;t realise how stuffed up I was. Looking back it&rsquo;s easy to see why my weight increased, my health decreased, my temprement went down hill etc and how my PTSD for email developed (honestly, the dread I feel when I hear my email go ping is debilitating). I&rsquo;m really starting to enjoy what I&rsquo;m doing again.</p>
<p>That enjoyment is starting to show. I have been super productive with my development activities. I&rsquo;m back on top of my python coding again and have built all sorts in the last few weeks including a number of ETL pipeines for my current customers as well as a few fun side projects. I&rsquo;ve wired up my Solar system to GitHub&rsquo;s new <a href="https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data">Flat Data workflow</a> so I now have robust hourly data going into a public repo so that I can track changes over time. There&rsquo;s nothing in there that is partcularly secret so <a href="https://github.com/andrewdotcom/enphaseData">i&rsquo;ve made it a public repo.</a>. I&rsquo;ve also refactored a few other things I have running on Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s around my property (weather, water tank levels etc etc).</p>
<p>This year I have noticed a dip in the quality of my eyesight. One thing I can say to younger developers is make sure you invest in looking after yourself(I can&rsquo;t believe I am typing that - I am still a young developer (40 is the new 20 right?? RIGHT!!!). I have made do with working on a laptop for too many years and I am paying the price for it. My eyes are screwed, my back and neck give me far too many problems too. I&rsquo;ve invested in a couple of new screens now that I work from home and I wish I had done this years ago. I think that there are a lot of developers who are now chipping over 40 who are experiencing problems and regretting not looking after themselves.</p>
<p>Anyway that&rsquo;s enough for this post. Things I&rsquo;ve learnt these last few weeks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate Change and the environment is the new Blockchain. In fact blockchain and climate change are coming togther into a meta marketing lie. A lot of people will make money peddling the Emporer&rsquo;s new
clothes in the next few years.</li>
<li>There is a lot of investment money in agriculture at the moment. I hope it continues into next year.</li>
<li>There are very few good ideas in Agriculture at the moment. How are we going to support the future?</li>
<li>Farmers are ready for good solutions.</li>
<li>Data is not the limiting factor. Capability and industry knowledge is.</li>
<li>Global first is the way to go.</li>
<li>Getting older sucks and is also awesome in unexpected ways.</li>
<li>Friends are golden.</li>
<li>Hobbies are important.</li>
<li>Family is everything. You only have one, you don&rsquo;t have them for long and nobody loves you more.</li>
<li>Chickens moult and when they do they look like they are dying.</li>
<li>Big tech companies need to consider how they interact with the tiny companies who might be the big ones of tomorrow.</li>
<li>I still dislike Power BI but I am starting to appreciate it more.</li>
