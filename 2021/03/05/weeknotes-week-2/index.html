      <p>Project <em>Terrigal</em> is continuing at pace. This week I had a few more meetings and realised that I really need to start getting my act together. It’s all getting a bit real.</p>
<p>I attended an advisory group for regenerative agriculture. Such a fascinating topic and so much money is being sunk into sustainability at the moment. Lots to get my head around in the carbon credits space.</p>
<p>Speaking of space, SpaceX had another successfulish test of the their starship this week. Such an inspiration.</p>
<p>The solar panels are working well producing about 50kwh a day. I knocked up a small script to log the daily output to my Twitter account as well as <a href="http://www.adafruit.io">adafruit.io</a>. When I have a few days data I’ll start posting some graphs. Maybe next week?</p>
<p>Things I learned this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m getting heavier rather than lighter. I really need to double down on healthy eating.</li>
<li>Primary maths can be challenging</li>
<li>Coffee tastes better when it’s free</li>
</ul>
