    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I thought that I would write a few words about how I calculate the Co2 emissions that I post to Twitter each day.</p>
<p>On my property I have 32 <a href="https://www.tindosolar.com.au">Tindo Solar</a> panels producing 15kWh of energy from the sun. Each day after the sun has gone down, I sum what has been generated and post it  to Twitter along with an estimate of how much Co2 it has saved from my daily carbon footprint.</p>
<p>I live in Australia and it’s no secret that as a country we are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Australia">terrible performer</a> when it comes to carbon emissions or anything <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/27/australia-accused-of-shamefully-holding-back-global-action-on-climate-change">climate related</a> for that matter. As a country we are still woefully reliant on burning fossil fuel for our energy and one of the major exporters of coal. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Australia">Wikipedia</a>, Co2 emissions per capita in Australia were 16.88 tonnes in 2018. This means that Australia has the 12th largest Co2 emissions per capita in the world just ahead of the US. As such I guess it should be no surprise that finding information about average per capita Co2 emissions is hard (some might say covered up). I have done a good amount of googling and found <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-quarterly-update-september-2020#download-the-full-report-and-data">here</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/australia?country=~AUS">here</a> which have some good information. In the end I plumped for a calculation of 0.256Kg per kWh. I don’t think this figure is ideal but it is the best I could come up with (I’m keen to hear if anyone reading this has a better source of information they can share).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the calculation I use for the information I post to Twitter is:</p>
<p>kWh produced * 0.256 = Co2 saved per day.</p>
<p>Pretty simple really.</p>
<p>As I start to monitor more of the resources I and my family produce/consume I’ll add to this page.</p>
