I thought that I would write a few words about how I calculate the Co2 emissions that I post to Twitter each day. 

On my property I have 32 [Tindo Solar](https://www.tindosolar.com.au) panels producing 15kWh of energy from the sun. Each day after the sun has gone down, I sum what has been generated and post it  to Twitter along with an estimate of how much Co2 it has saved from my daily carbon footprint. 

I live in Australia and it’s no secret that as a country we are a [terrible performer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Australia) when it comes to carbon emissions or anything [climate related](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/27/australia-accused-of-shamefully-holding-back-global-action-on-climate-change) for that matter. As a country we are still woefully reliant on burning fossil fuel for our energy and one of the major exporters of coal. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Australia), Co2 emissions per capita in Australia was 16.88 tonnes in 2018 which makes that Australia has the 12th largest Co2 emissions per capita just ahead of the US. As such I guess it should be no surprise that finding information about average per capita Co2 emissions is hard. I have done a good amount of googling and found [here](https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-quarterly-update-september-2020#download-the-full-report-and-data) and [here](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/australia?country=~AUS) which have some good information. In the end I plumped for a calculation of 0.256Kg per kWh. I don’t think this figure is ideal but it is the best I could come up with (I’m keen to hear if anyone reading this has a better source of information they can share). 

Ultimately, the calculation I use for the information I post to Twitter is:

kWh produced * 0.256 = Co2 saved per day. 

Pretty simple really. 

As I start to monitor more of the resources I and my family produce/consume I’ll add to this page.
