New blog new rhythm, new me so I thought I’d have a stab at weeknotes. 

This week I went back to work after a few days off. I’m starting up a new personal project - we’ll call it _terrigal_. It’s going to be a big deal for me so I started making some phone calls. I’ve also had a few other ideas for small experiments in food and fibre that I’m going to make a start on. 

This week also sees the installation of solar on my property. I’ve gone a bit mad and plumped for a tindo solar panel with enphase micro inverter system. Expect to see lots more about this and the energy produced. 

I found that there is a local hacker space not too far from my home. I’m keen to get back into the hack and tell world so will go and check it out at the next meetup. Of course covid is still making all of this more complicated but at least the vaccine roll out is starting here in Australia. As a pretty average healthy (ish) adult I’m quite a long way towards the back of the queue. 

Still mucking about with the raspberry Pi pico. I found it can emulate the BBC micro this week. When I find some time I’ll have some fun with that. I’ve been wanting to rediscover BASIC for a while now. 

Things I learned this week:

* I can drive a digger. 
* Diggers make more mess than they clear up. 
* I like tofu. 
* I’m not that sensitive to ASMR.
