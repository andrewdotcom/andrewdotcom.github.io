This week has been a week of development. The first full week I have had in many years and I have loved it. I have been building out some python scripts to ingest historic data from an API my client uses within their application for reporting. Ultimately these scripts will form the core of the ingestion pipeline that I am putting together. I’m having so much fun. Part of the process has been getting on the phone with customers of the data to drill down into how data will help them improve their businesses. The opportunities in agriculture remain deep and wide. There is also so much opportunity to think differently. The findings of a recent PhD theses I read stated that producers and supply chain participants used their mobile devices as much as in any other industry. The challenge has been that there are so few useful apps in Ag. That’s a big opportunity. 

I have also been getting my hands dirty with Power BI. It’s not a tool that I know well but I have produced some dashboards in the past. Every article I read about PowerBI suggests that it’s a tool that is intuitive and easy to use. I think that is true for the simplest of dashboards but the DAX language is a bit like AppleScript - it tries to be easy but seems to make everything harder in the long run. I think it’s going to take a while to master everything that Power BI has to offer. I also need to decide if I want to.

Other things this week include starting to build out the business model for More than Machines. I realised that I am having trouble articulating the elevator pitch to people. Not good. I know that I want to create some kind of studio that experiments on the edges of design, technology and product within the AgriFood space. There are loads of interesting models out there that I can take inspiration from. For example the [IDEO CoLab](https://www.ideocolab.com/) running time limited research programs for corporate organisations or [Space10](https://space10.com/) who experiment on behalf of IKEA and everything in between. There are lots of interesting models out there to inspiration from. How this get’s a conservative industry to solid outcomes is the main challenge.

What I learnt this week:

* Business models seem simple on the surface but there is a lot needed to get to something that feels right (and that might make money)
* I still love programming in Python.
* The Australian Government may never get around to vaccinating the population
* The value of a haircut to the general UK population is high
* That the Etymology of Venus includes venereal which seems a bit unfortunate for the goddess of love.
