Tired. Soooo tired. I've been in the office in Sydney a few times this week to start to get myself back into the swing of what work used to be like. To be honest, i'm not sure how I used to do it. Getting up before five and commuting for 4 hours a day isn't fun but it could be worse. The downside is that I am a bit tired and grumpy by the time Friday comes around - it doesn't help that yesterday I got home to find that my two new Silkie chickens had figured out a way to get out of the hen house (i'm still not 100% sure how they did it) and are now missing. Chooks outside of the hen house have not faired well to date so I am not holding out hope I will see them again.

It's been another challenging week with work - at the end of the day adults are just kids in bigger bodies, in many ways kids might have it more together.

I've spent a few brain cycles this week thinking about the new hotness that are NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). If you want proof that the world is going nuts then you need look no further. This week an artist called Beeple sold a digital artwork for $69 million through Christies auction house. Before that his most expensive artwork sold for $100 although he has created an artwork every day for 14 years. NFTs are unique files that live on a blockchain and can be used to to verify (limited) ownership of things such as a work of digital art. I can see lots of opportunities for the agriculture sector but the sustainability credentials of blockchain look iffier by the day.

Things I learned this week:

* The amount of sleep I get and my mental health are very closely linked - both are declining. 
* Chickens will always find a way out of the most secure chookhouse.
* My management style isn't to everyone's taste and i'm ok with that.
* The time to write weeknotes comes around very quickly.
