I don't notice things very much anymore. It might be age or routine but I don't notice myself noting things like I used to. I don't see things like I used to.

I'm not sure if this is a bad thing? Maybe my mind is full and I need a break for things to perculate, to settle down and to lay the sediment lines of my mind. The downside is that life feels autonomous, like I am on a pre-determined track of routine that I need to derail.

In a world that looks to be falling apart, noticing feels more important than ever.
