It's turning out to be a lot harder than I imagined to sit down each week and write up a set of weeknotes. I think I may be over complicating it. Eitherway I am quite a few weeks behind now. So many in fact that I have forgotten what week I am on.

Going forward i am just going to write up weeknotes when I can and bring all the things that have happened in the period together. We'll also drop the week number.

So what has happened? Well More than Machines continues to develop. Lots of interesting conversations and a few pieces of work. Still tracking behind on sales but i'm only 8 weeks in and have been focused on one customer to date. If I am honest I have also been taking it easy. I burned out in my previous job and I am only just starting to feel human again. I didn't realise how stuffed up I was. Looking back it's easy to see why my weight increased, my health decreased, my temprement went down hill etc and how my PTSD for email developed (honestly, the dread I feel when I hear my email go ping is debilitating). I'm really starting to enjoy what I'm doing again.

That enjoyment is starting to show. I have been super productive with my development activities. I'm back on top of my python coding again and have built all sorts in the last few weeks including a number of ETL pipeines for my current customers as well as a few fun side projects. I've wired up my Solar system to GitHub's new [Flat Data workflow](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data) so I now have robust hourly data going into a public repo so that I can track changes over time. There's nothing in there that is partcularly secret so [i've made it a public repo.](https://github.com/andrewdotcom/enphaseData). I've also refactored a few other things I have running on Raspberry Pi's around my property (weather, water tank levels etc etc).

This year I have noticed a dip in the quality of my eyesight. One thing I can say to younger developers is make sure you invest in looking after yourself(I can't believe I am typing that - I am still a young developer (40 is the new 20 right?? RIGHT!!!). I have made do with working on a laptop for too many years and I am paying the price for it. My eyes are screwed, my back and neck give me far too many problems too. I've invested in a couple of new screens now that I work from home and I wish I had done this years ago. I think that there are a lot of developers who are now chipping over 40 who are experiencing problems and regretting not looking after themselves.

Anyway that's enough for this post. Things I've learnt these last few weeks are:

* Climate Change and the environment is the new Blockchain. In fact blockchain and climate change are coming togther into a meta marketing lie. A lot of people will make money peddling the Emporer's new 
clothes in the next few years.
* There is a lot of investment money in agriculture at the moment. I hope it continues into next year.
* There are very few good ideas in Agriculture at the moment. How are we going to support the future?
* Farmers are ready for good solutions.
* Data is not the limiting factor. Capability and industry knowledge is.
* Global first is the way to go.
* Getting older sucks and is also awesome in unexpected ways.
* Friends are golden.
* Hobbies are important.
* Family is everything. You only have one, you don't have them for long and nobody loves you more.
* Chickens moult and when they do they look like they are dying.
* Big tech companies need to consider how they interact with the tiny companies who might be the big ones of tomorrow.
* I still dislike Power BI but I am starting to appreciate it more.
