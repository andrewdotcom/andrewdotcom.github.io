Project _Terrigal_ is continuing at pace. This week I had a few more meetings and realised that I really need to start getting my act together. It’s all getting a bit real. 

I attended an advisory group for regenerative agriculture. Such a fascinating topic and so much money is being sunk into sustainability at the moment. Lots to get my head around in the carbon credits space. 

Speaking of space, SpaceX had another successfulish test of the their starship this week. Such an inspiration. 

The solar panels are working well producing about 50kwh a day. I knocked up a small script to log the daily output to my Twitter account as well as [adafruit.io](http://www.adafruit.io). When I have a few days data I’ll start posting some graphs. Maybe next week?

Things I learned this week:

* I’m getting heavier rather than lighter. I really need to double down on healthy eating. 
* Primary maths can be challenging
* Coffee tastes better when it’s free
