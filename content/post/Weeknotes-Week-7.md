I feel I write this a lot at the moment but It's pretty crazy how fast the weeks have been going by. So much so that I have managed to miss a few weeks of weeknotes. Not a really great start on my part but there has been a lot more than usual going on! Over the last three weeks I have been focused on finishing up at Meat and Livestock Australia where I have been Chief Data Officer for the last 4 years. It's the longest tenure I have had in any role and it's been amazing. Challenging in many, many ways but I have grown so much and had the opporunity to meet some truely wonderful people across Australian agriculture and beyond. At the end of the day though my itch to make things got too strong and I am now returning to my Software Engineering roots. Project _Terrigal_ can now be revealed as my new company More Than Machines! They say that naming things is the hardest thing to do in software engineering and they're not kidding. It took a very long time to land on something I thought was appropriate. I think it describes what I'll (and soon to be we'll) be doing pretty well. More on that in future posts but I have been thinking for some time now about how experimentation, software and hardware engineering, research and design can come together to create new products, new business models and provide real outcomes for stakeholders. All done in short periods of time (or multiples of) and in the open highlighing the journey as, as important as the destination. Wow that's a lot to take in and it all needs to be refined but it's a start. I certainly have the right mix of excitement and sheer terror I think.

Other things that have been going on this week include experimenting with Google Chrome extensions. The more I tinker the more I realise how underused these are. There are many opportunities to customise existing user experiences and hyper personalising them. I've also been looking at personal assistants in Discord. Basically bots that run around you automating the little things and bringing together information. In a world where there is so much information a bot that can keep an eye on things and tell me when I should go look seems useful. There's lots of opportunities to overlay some interesting technologies there too.

Next week More Than Machines takes on it's first partnership. Very exciting!
