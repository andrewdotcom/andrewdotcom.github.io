It's been a big week this week. After 3.5 years as Chief Data Officer for Meat and Livestock Australia, I have decided to leave. I have lots of emotions, sadness, excitement and pure terror. Now I have to focus on getting project _Terrigal_ finalised.

It's been a week of torrential rain here in New South Wales, I've never seen anything like it. It has rained solidly all week. There's so much water. I've spent more than one evening this week in the garden digging trenches to divert flood water away from my property.

Things I've learnt this week:

* It's hard to get professional indemnity insurance as an independent Data Engineer (due to security risk mainly)
* The Rust programming language is a really interesting language and I love the compiler. It feels like it's going to take me a while to be productive in the language though.
* I have a lot of good people around me who care about me.
