Hi! My name is Andrew Skinner. I am a ~~Brit~~ Australian living somewhere on the beautiful [NSW Central Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(New_South_Wales)). I self identify as a Software Engineer, data geek and maker of things. I have been doing these things for quite a long time. I specialise getting technology into challenging environments (and yes, that can also include offices, peoples living rooms and into web browsers). As such, I lead teams of talented digital experts inventing and delivering new software products and services across industries. For the last few years I have been working in Agriculture.

I have a long torrid history of blogging. I often wonder if I may be the most failed blogger on the web. After literally hundreds of failed attempts and broken new year resolutions I now look with envy at many of my friends and colleagues who have persevered with writing over the years and who now have a rich record of their lives and professional careers. This is my final attempt to do something similar for myself.

As such the topics on this blog are likely to be fairly random and the prose is highly likely to be of average quality. If I am going to make this work I am going to have to write about what I am thinking at the time and it is quite likely to be... nonsense.

Apart from here, you can also find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/andrewdotcom), [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/andrewtakespics) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy2307/) where I have been a more reliable contributor.
