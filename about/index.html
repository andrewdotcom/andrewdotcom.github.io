      <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Skinner. I am a <del>Brit</del> Australian living somewhere on the beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(New_South_Wales)">NSW Central Coast</a>. I am a Software Engineer, data geek and maker of things. I have been doing these things for quite a long time. I specialise getting technology into challenging environments (and yes, that can also include offices, people&rsquo;s living rooms and into web browsers). As such, I lead teams of talented digital experts inventing and delivering new software products and services across industries. For the last few years I have been working in Agriculture.</p>
<p>I have a long torrid history of blogging. I often wonder if I may be the most failed blogger on the web. After literally hundreds of failed attempts and broken new year resolutions I now look with envy at many of my friends and colleagues who have persevered with writing over the years and who now have a rich record of their lives and professional careers. This is my final attempt to do something similar for myself.</p>
<p>As such the topics on this blog are likely to be fairly random and the prose is highly likely to be of average quality. If I am going to make this work I am going to have to write about what I am thinking at the time and it is quite likely to be&hellip; nonsense.</p>
<p>Apart from here, you can also find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andrewdotcom">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/andrewtakespics">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy2307/">LinkedIn</a> where I have been a more reliable contributor.</p>
