      <description>Tired. Soooo tired. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the office in Sydney a few times this week to start to get myself back into the swing of what work used to be like. ZTo be honest, i&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I used to do it. Getting up before five and commuting for 4 hours a day isn&amp;rsquo;t fun but it could be worse. The downside is that I am a bit tired and grumpy by the time Friday comes around - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that yesterday I got home to find that my two new Silkie chickens had figured out a way to get out of the hen house (i&amp;rsquo;m still not 100% sure how they did it) and are now missing.</description>

      <description>Project Terrigal is continuing at pace. This week I had a few more meetings and realised that I really need to start getting my act together. It’s all getting a bit real.
I attended an advisory group for regenerative agriculture. Such a fascinating topic and so much money is being sunk into sustainability at the moment. Lots to get my head around in the carbon credits space.
Speaking of space, SpaceX had another successfulish test of the their starship this week.</description>

      <title>How I calculate my carbon savings</title>

      <description>I thought that I would write a few words about how I calculate the Co2 emissions that I post to Twitter each day.
On my property I have 32 Tindo Solar panels producing 15kWh of energy from the sun. Each day after the sun has gone down, I sum what has been generated and post it to Twitter along with an estimate of how much Co2 it has saved from my daily carbon footprint.</description>

      <description>New blog new rhythm, new me so I thought I’d have a stab at weeknotes.
This week I went back to work after a few days off. I’m starting up a new personal project - we’ll call it terrigal. It’s going to be a big deal for me so I started making some phone calls. I’ve also had a few other ideas for small experiments in food and fibre that I’m going to make a start on.</description>
