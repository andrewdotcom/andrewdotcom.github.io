      <description>I thought that I would write a few words about how I calculate the Co2 emissions that I post to Twitter each day.
On my property I have 32 Tindo Solar panels producing 15kWh of energy from the sun. Each day after the sun has gone down, I sum what has been generated and post it to Twitter along with an estimate of how much Co2 it has saved from my daily carbon footprint.</description>

      <description>New blog new rhythm, new me so I thought I’d have a stab at weeknotes.
This week I went back to work after a few days off. I’m starting up a new personal project - we’ll call it terrigal. It’s going to be a big deal for me so I started making some phone calls. I’ve also had a few other ideas for small experiments in food and fibre that I’m going to make a start on.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Andrew Skinner. I am a Brit Australian living somewhere on the beautiful NSW Central Coast. I self identify as a Software Engineer, data geek and maker of things. I have been doing these things for quite a long time. I specialise getting technology into challenging environments (and yes, that can also include offices, peoples living rooms and into web browsers). As such, I lead teams of talented digital experts inventing and delivering new software products and services across industries.</description>
